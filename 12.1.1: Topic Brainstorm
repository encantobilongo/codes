a. MySpace, to connect people, it represents social media because it was one of the largest, original social media sites that connect people all over the world. It had become such a cultural phenomenae that memes were even made of it. It was also used for many pranks, jokes, and so on, and definitely connected the entire world. MySpace's purpose was just to be a complex (for that time, now basic) social media website that could connect people and contain images, videos, and so on. It has left an impact on culture as an old relic of the past.
b. I will first have to make a basic NodeJS server that will contain all message data (it will basically be a basic website board without images, that's too much data for a small server) and create the HTTPS and CSS frontend and code all the website functions in JS.
c. It has connected people all across the world. It has made people laugh and be as one. But it has also made people sad, angry, depressed, and so on. Current social media has the potential to do this BUT TO AN EVEN FARTHER EXTENT. It could seperate people, make them angry because that's what gets clicks. It wil become a sort of "hyper-capitalism" that profits out of anything it could find out of people, even if it hurts the consumer base's lives.
d. The Internet itself, JavaScript, and server networking. CSS as well!
